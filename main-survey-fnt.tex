\begin{abstract}
We focus on some specific problems in distribution testing,
taking goodness-of-fit as a running example. In particular,
we do not aim to provide a comprehensive summary of all
the topics in the area; but will provide self-contained proofs and derivations of the main results, trying
to highlight the unifying techniques.

\todonote{Pinsker, $\chi^2$, etc.~\cref{fact:dpi} as a consequence of TV being an $f$-divergence.}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{app:distances:chi2:tv}
  \[
    \totalvardist{\p}{\q}^2 \leq \frac{1}{4}\chisquare{\p}{\q}
  \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Cauchy--Schwarz, 
  \begin{align*}
      \totalvardist{\p}{\q} &= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{x\in\domain} \abs{\p(x)-\q(x)} \\
      &\leq \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\sum_{x\in\domain} \frac{(\p(x)-\q(x))^2}{\q(x)}}\sqrt{\sum_{x\in\domain} \q(x)} \\
      &= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\chisquare{\p}{\q}}\,.
  \end{align*}
