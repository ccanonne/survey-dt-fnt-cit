\begin{abstract}
We focus on some specific problems in distribution testing,
taking goodness-of-fit as a running example. In particular,
we do not aim to provide a comprehensive summary of all
the topics in the area; but will provide self-contained proofs and derivations of the main results, trying
to highlight the unifying techniques.
